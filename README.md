Yet another Twitter user intersection app.

    (intersect)stagger:intersect paulmison$ python console.py 

Note that (almost) everything in that is hardcoded. You might be better off with the web app:

    (intersect)stagger:intersect paulmison$ python website.py 

Now with D3 and nicely styled lists, and a [hosted version](http://intersect.husk.org/).

It's probably also useful for cribbing how to write Twitter oAuth using [sixohsix's Twitter library](https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter).
